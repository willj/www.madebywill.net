title: Pingdom Pulse Update
date: 2011/06/23

I’ve just published a minor update to Pingdom Pulse for Windows Phone. Pingdom Pulse is a simple Pingdom client to help you monitor your servers wherever you are.

The biggest change in this release is the addition of an outages pivot. This shows the date/time and duration of all outages for a particular server over the last 30 days.

I have plans to add more functionality to Pingdom Pulse and I’d love to hear what you think is missing, you can contact me from within the app or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/willj).
